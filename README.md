# Model Using Two Approaches 1.Using Selenium on Instagram 2.Using Twitter API
update your google chrome to use task.py
#task.py usesBeautiful Soup to get the Top Headlines from 2 Pages of NDTV and estimating its Probability of Virality
Further Used Selenium for Using following the taglines from the head lines and deriving the number of activity on the tagline and estimating the probability of virality based on past number of posts.. A simple model. Just started out couldnt get any data from kaggle to work on with.
I am also developing it with a twitter api to get better insights to a post.
Will link to it once i get it done.

#Model Using Twitter API
i have added the twitter api model of prediction written in file task2.py.
it compares the trend with a reference viral trend and gives a real time estimation of the probability of virality
the data sampling of any headlines must be done accorfing to the sampling time of the reference post. more data that we have , more accurate the model can be.
